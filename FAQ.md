### What is Chit Fund
#### Definition:
- A chit fund is a type of rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA) system practiced in India. It's a financial arrangement where a group of people contribute a fixed amount of money periodically (say monthly) into a common pool, and at regular intervals, one member gets access to the total collected amount, usually through a bidding or lottery system.

#### How it works:
- Suppose 20 people agree to contribute ₹5,000 each month.
= Each month, ₹1,00,000 (5,000 × 20) is collected.
= Then through an auction or lottery, one person gets the pot (after deducting organizer commission or other fees).
- The cycle continues until all 20 members get the pot once.

#### Purpose:
- It's a way to save regularly and get access to a lump sum of money when needed, acting like a loan and an investment simultaneously.

#### Regulation:
- Chit funds are regulated under the Chit Funds Act, 1982 in India (for formal chit funds). However, many informal, unregistered chit groups also exist.

### What is Kitty Party
#### Defnition:
- A kitty party is mainly a social gathering (popular among women) where each member contributes a certain amount of money (the "kitty") during the gathering, and one member gets the entire kitty amount each month — usually decided by draw.

#### How it works:
- Suppose 12 friends gather once a month.
- Each contributes ₹2,000.
- The total kitty is ₹24,000.
- One member (chosen by lucky draw or other simple method) takes home ₹24,000 that month.
- Next month, another member wins, and so on, until all have received the kitty once.

#### Purpose:
- Originally started to encourage savings among women who might not have their own independent income streams. Over time, it became a mix of saving + entertainment + socializing.

#### Difference from chit fund:
- Chit fund is more formal and often business-like (sometimes profit-based with discounts, auctions, and organizer fees).
- Kitty party is more informal, focused on social bonding, and the money distribution is usually without any bidding/auction.

### Example of BID System in Chit Fund
#### Suppose:
- 10 members.
- Each agrees to pay ₹10,000 per month.
- So, the total chit fund collected each month = ₹1,00,000.

#### Now, the first month:
- Members bid to get the fund early.

#### Let's say Member A says:
➔ “I am willing to take ₹90,000 instead of ₹1,00,000.”
(which means they are offering a discount of ₹10,000.)

That ₹10,000 "discount" is distributed among the other 9 members (or sometimes organizer keeps some commission).

#### So:

- Member A gets ₹90,000.
- Other 9 members get ₹10,000 ÷ 9 ≈ ₹1,111 each as a bonus.
- Every member including Member A must keep paying ₹10,000 every month until the cycle completes (all 10 months) but, member A won't participate in further draws.

### Example of Lottery System in Chit Fund
#### Suppose:
- Same setup: 10 members, ₹10,000 each → ₹1,00,000 total per month.

#### In the first month:

- No one bids (or no one wants to take at a discount).
- Then, a random lottery is done among all 10 members.
- Suppose Member C wins the lottery.
- Member C gets full ₹1,00,000 (no discount).
- Member C must keep paying ₹10,000 every month even after winning.

#### In the next months:

- Member C is NOT eligible for winning again.
- Only the remaining 9 members are eligible in month 2.
- Then 8 members in month 3.
- And so on until every member wins once.

✅ Key Point:

- One-time win only.
- After winning, you still keep contributing, but you won't participate in further draws.

| :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Example of bid?                          | Someone says "I'll take ₹90,000 instead of ₹1,00,000", and the ₹10,000 saved is shared by others.         |
| How is money given back?                 | Either through bid (lowest bidder gets) or lottery (random selection). Full or discounted amount is paid. |
| After winning, do they still contribute? | **Yes, absolutely.** Until the end of the chit cycle.                                                     |
| After winning, can they win again?       | **No.** Once a person wins, they are removed from the draw/bid eligibility but continue paying.           |
